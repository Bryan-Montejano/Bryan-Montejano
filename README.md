# Hi, I'm Bryan Montejano

**Fraud Analytics / AML Engineer** · **End-to-End Data Pipelines** · **Apache Spark** · **Neo4j / Graph Analytics**

I build production-grade analytics workflows for fraud & financial crime: from raw data → features → graph signals → monitoring.

## About

- **Fraud Analytics / AML**: detection signals, risk scoring, and investigation-friendly outputs.
- **End-to-end pipelines**: ingestion, transformation, feature engineering, validation, and delivery (batch-oriented, scalable).
- **Graph thinking**: relationship modeling and graph-driven signals with **Neo4j**.

---

## What I do

- Design and implement **Spark pipelines** (PySpark / Spark SQL), with partition strategies and performance tuning.
- Build **entity linking** and network features (communities, centrality, proximity signals) using **Neo4j**.
- Add **data quality** checks and monitoring patterns to keep pipelines reliable over time.
